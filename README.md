# Sell-Out
Created an instgram style application in swift where users can post items they wish to sell. Others can see where the item is located and see a description of the item. The app uses firebase as its databse to hold all the users posts and accounts. Once the user signs up they will receive an eamil, where they will have to veriy there email. Next step for this app is to allow both users to chat in app.
